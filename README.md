## ✨ Features

**😎 100% open source and free**

Backend (Rust) and infrastructure codes (AWS CDK) are open sources.

**🚀 Uptime guarantee**

There are some telegram bots available already. But they are not able to provide a continuous experience because of long downtimes. This is the main reason for the existence of notifine.

**🎓 Educational purposes**

I am planning to prepare a tutorial based on this project. And help new Rustaceans with an up-to-date Rust implementation.

**⚡️ Built on Rust**

Benefit Rust features of speed, type safety, async.

**🔌 On premise available**

If you want to host the bot on your private server.
